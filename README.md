Running an untested model? [scripts/register_scan.py](scripts/register_scan.py) produces a read-only report comparing your inverter against the register map this integration expects. Attaching its output to an issue is what makes a device supportable, see [Register Scan](CONTRIBUTING.md#register-scan).

## Supported Home Assistant Versions

Home Assistant **2025.12.0** is the earliest supported version. HACS blocks installing it on older releases, and CI tests every change against both 2025.12.0 and a recent release.

---

## Prerequisites

The ModBus must be enabled by your EcoFlow Partner / Installer, it is disabled by default!

## Battery Control

Off by default. Turning on the **Modbus Control** switch (in the device's
Configuration section) makes the integration hold control authority over the
inverter, which **locks the EcoFlow app out control** for as long as the
integration is running and the switch is on. Turning it off hands control back to
the app after about 60 seconds.

The **Battery Mode** select is the primary control:

| Mode              | What the inverter does                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Automatic         | Self-consumption, exactly as the app runs it                                   |
| Hold battery      | Don't charge or discharge the battery. Surplus solar power is exported         |
| Charge battery    | Charges at the set power, importing from the grid if solar power is not enough |
| Discharge battery | Discharges at the set power                                                    |
| Export to grid    | Exports at the set power, uses the battery if solar power is not enough        |

Charge and Export are two views of the same thing: **Charge pins the battery and lets the
grid float, Export pins the grid and lets the battery float.** The setpoint is a target
rather than a cap in both directions, and as long as the battery has room the inverter
reaches it without limiting solar, with whatever is left over going to the battery or is
exported.

Two guards apply in every mode, including Automatic. They can only stop the battery:

- **Charge Limit** – the battery is not charged above this state of charge (100 = off)
- **Battery Reserve** – the battery is not discharged below this state of charge (0 = off)

The inverter has no setting for a charge limit, so while a guard is on the integration
runs self-consumption itself. It tells the inverter what it would have done anyway,
except in the direction the guard forbids. With the Charge Limit on, the battery can
still power the house. With the Battery Reserve on, it can still charge from solar. The
guard stays on until the state of charge has moved 5% back, because the inverter would
start charging (or discharging) again within seconds if it got control back earlier.

There is one exception. If the house clearly uses more than the solar for a minute
while the Charge Limit is on, the only thing the battery can do is discharge, which the
limit allows. The inverter does that faster and more smoothly by itself, so the
integration lets it. The same goes for a clear solar surplus while the Battery Reserve
is on. The integration takes over again as soon as the power flow turns. Leave Min SOC
and schedules in the EcoFlow app off, since the inverter follows them when it runs by
itself.

If a load keeps switching on and off, like an oven heating in bursts, the integration
waits longer each time before letting go, so it settles instead of switching back and
forth. Small power corrections wait until the battery has reached the last one, because
some inverters start over on every new setting.

The guards are soft limits: the battery can move the wrong way for a few seconds before
the integration catches it, which is harmless for battery wear or a backup reserve.

While the battery is held near zero it will wander a few hundred watts either way as
clouds come and go. This is due to the inverter itself balancing and unfortunately
EcoFlow doesn't expose the robust power limit that the app's Schedule feature uses.
Read more about that in
[Battery power limits](EcoFlow_PowerOcean_Modbus.md#battery-power-limits).

Both guards default to off. Separately, **Modbus Control** defaults to off, so an
untouched install never takes control away from the app.
**Control Status** shows what the selected mode is achieving, including which guard is
on and whether a full or empty battery blocks the target. If the inverter misses the
target a guard sets, the status shows Ramping or Unreachable instead of the guard. The guard is still available as a `guard` attribute on the Control Status sensor,
for automations to read and act on.

| Control Status             | Meaning                                                         |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No Modbus control          | Modbus Control is disabled or control authority was lost        |
| Handing back to the app    | Modbus Control was switched off; the app takes over within 60 s |
| Automatic                  | The inverter is running its normal self-consumption mode        |
| Active                     | The selected target is being maintained                         |
| Ramping                    | The inverter has not reached the target for a few polls         |
| Charge limit reached       | The Charge Limit guard is preventing further charging           |
| Reserve reached            | The Battery Reserve guard is preventing further discharge       |
| Unreachable: battery full  | The target requires the battery to absorb power, but it cannot  |
| Unreachable: battery empty | The target requires the battery to supply power, but it cannot  |

On the device page the two are deliberately kept apart:

| Section           | Entities                                                                                        | Meaning                                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Controls**      | Battery Mode, Charge/Discharge/Export Power                                                     | What you are asking the inverter to do right now                 |
| **Configuration** | Modbus Control, Charge Limit, Battery Reserve, LED Brightness, Battery Saver Mode, Grid Feed-in | Standing settings; the two guards bind whatever mode is selected |
| **Sensors**       | Control Status                                                                                  | What the inverter is actually doing about it                     |

Each mode's power stays editable while another mode is selected, so a command can be
set up before it is needed. Only the selected mode's value is ever sent.

## Technical Details

- **Protocol:** Modbus TCP (port 502)
- **Reads:** Holding Registers (Function Code 3); multi-register values are decoded
  low word first (word-swapped)
- **Writes:** Function Code 6 for one register and Function Code 16 for multiple
  registers; multi-register values are encoded high word first
- **Float encoding:** 32-bit IEEE 754
- **Read strategy:** 3 block reads per poll cycle, grouped automatically from the
  register addresses, plus one device-information read when the connection opens
- **Tested firmware:** 3.0.19.19 + 3.0.20.54(PO+)
- **Tested pymodbus version:** 3.6.9, 3.11.x and 3.13.x

The register map lives in [`const.py`](custom_components/ef_powerocean_tcpmodbus/const.py) as absolute Modbus addresses. For address numbering, word order, decoding and known gaps, see [EcoFlow_PowerOcean_Modbus.md](EcoFlow_PowerOcean_Modbus.md).
