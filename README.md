## Battery Control

Off by default. Turning **Modbus Control** on makes the integration hold control
authority over the inverter, which **locks the EcoFlow app out control** for
as long as the integration is running and Modbus Control is turned on.

The **Battery Mode** select is the primary control:

| Mode              | What the inverter does                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Automatic         | Self-consumption, exactly as the app runs it                                   |
| Hold battery      | Don't charge or discharge the battery. Surplus solar power is exported         |
| Charge battery    | Charges at the set power, importing from the grid if solar power is not enough |
| Discharge battery | Discharges at the set power                                                    |
| Export to grid    | Exports at the set power, uses the battery if solar power is not enough        |

Charge and Export are two views of the same thing: **Charge pins the battery and lets the
grid float, Export pins the grid and lets the battery float.** The setpoint is a target
rather than a cap in both directions, and as long as the battery has room the inverter
reaches it without limiting solar, with whatever is left over going to the battery or is
exported.

Two guards apply in every mode, including Automatic, and only ever restrict:

- **Charge Limit** – state of charge above which the battery is not charged (100 = off)
- **Battery Reserve** – state of charge below which it is not drained (0 = off)

Both guards default to off. Separately, **Modbus Control** defaults to off, so an
untouched install never takes control away from the app.
**Control Status** reports what the selected mode is achieving, including when a guard
is holding it or when the battery has no headroom left to reach the target.

| Control Status             | Meaning                                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No Modbus control          | Modbus Control is disabled or control authority was lost       |
| Automatic                  | The inverter is running its normal self-consumption mode       |
| Active                     | The selected target is being maintained                        |
| Ramping                    | The inverter is moving toward the selected target              |
| Charge limit reached       | The Charge Limit guard is preventing further charging          |
| Reserve reached            | The Battery Reserve guard is preventing further discharge      |
| Unreachable: battery full  | The target requires the battery to absorb power, but it cannot |
| Unreachable: battery empty | The target requires the battery to supply power, but it cannot |

On the device page the two are deliberately kept apart:

| Section           | Entities                                                          | Meaning                                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Controls**      | Battery Mode, Charge/Discharge/Export Power                       | What you are asking the inverter to do right now                 |
| **Configuration** | Charge Limit, Battery Reserve, LED Brightness, Battery Saver Mode | Standing settings; the two guards bind whatever mode is selected |
| **Sensors**       | Control Status                                                    | What the inverter is actually doing about it                     |

Each mode's power stays editable while another mode is selected, so a command can be
set up before it is needed. Only the selected mode's value is ever sent.

---

## Automating: the `set_control` service

You can drive all the entities above from an automation already, but setting a mode and its power takes two calls, and the first one sends whatever power that mode was last given before the second one corrects it. `ef_powerocean_tcpmodbus.set_control` sets everything in one go, so the inverter only ever hears the finished intent. It can also hold that command for a while and then let go.

```yaml
action: ef_powerocean_tcpmodbus.set_control
target:
  entity_id: select.ecoflow_powerocean_battery_mode
data:
  mode: charge_battery
  power: 3000
```

### Letting the command end by itself

Pass a `duration`, an `until` condition, or both.

```yaml
# Two hours, then back to Automatic
data:
  mode: charge_battery
  power: 3000
  duration: "02:00:00"
```

```yaml
# Until the battery reaches 80%
data:
  mode: charge_battery
  power: 3000
  until:
    condition: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.ecoflow_powerocean_battery_soc
    above: 79
```

`until` takes Home Assistant's own condition config, so anything you can write in an automation works here: `numeric_state`, `state`, `template`, `for:`, and nested `and` / `or` / `not`.

```yaml
# Export while the price is high and the battery is above 40%,
# and give up after four hours either way
data:
  mode: export_to_grid
  power: 5000
  duration: "04:00:00"
  until:
    condition: or
    conditions:
      - condition: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.electricity_price
        below: 0.25
      - condition: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.ecoflow_powerocean_battery_soc
        below: 40
```

`until_mode` decides how `duration` and `until` combine:

| `until_mode`    | Behaviour                                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `any` (default) | Whichever comes first ends the command                          |
| `all`           | Both must hold. Requires **both** `duration` and `until` be set |

`revert_to` picks what it falls back to, and defaults to `automatic`. Whichever mode it reverts to uses that mode's own stored power.

Set it to `previous` to restore whatever was selected when the command started, which lets an automation slot in a temporary override without knowing or caring what was running before.

```yaml
# Export for an hour, then put things back the way they were
data:
  mode: export_to_grid
  power: 5000
  duration: "01:00:00"
  revert_to: previous
```

| `power`               | watts        | Clamped to the inverter's ceiling. Rejected for modes that have no setpoint           |
| `charge_limit_soc`    | 0-100        | Sets the Charge Limit guard in the same call                                          |
| `battery_reserve_soc` | 0-100        | Sets the Battery Reserve guard in the same call                                       |
| `duration`            | `"HH:MM:SS"` | Capped at 24 hours                                                                    |
| `until`               | HA condition | Ends the command once it becomes true                                                 |
| `until_mode`          | `any`, `all` | Default `any`                                                                         |
| `revert_to`           | mode         | Or `previous` to restore what was selected before. Default `automatic`                |

### Things worth knowing

- **Nothing happens if the end condition is already true.** Asking to charge until 80% when the battery is at 85% sends no command at all, rather than entering the mode and unwinding it a moment later. It gets logged at info level.
- **Any new intent cancels a running window.** Picking a mode from the Battery Mode select, or making a second `set_control` call, drops the pending revert, so an override you thought you had replaced will not come back to bite you later.
- **Guards do not cancel it.** Hitting the Charge Limit means the command is being honoured, not changed, so the window keeps running.
- **A window never survives a restart.** The selected mode is deliberately not restored across restarts, so there is nothing left to revert to. And if Home Assistant stops while a command is being held, the heartbeat lapses and the inverter hands control back to the app on its own. That is the real safety net under all of this.
- **An `until` entity that goes `unavailable` counts as "not yet"**, so the command keeps running. This is why `until_mode: all` insists on a `duration`: without one, an unavailable sensor could hold the mode indefinitely.
- **A failed revert is retried** on the next poll instead of being dropped.
- **`revert_at`** shows up as an attribute on the Battery Mode select while a timed command is running, so a dashboard or another automation can see it and stay out of the way.

### Chaining commands together

When a timed command ends, the integration fires an `ef_powerocean_tcpmodbus_command_ended` event, so one command can pick up where another left off.

| Event data    | Meaning                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`   | The Battery Mode select the command belonged to                   |
| `device_id`   | The inverter it ran on, stable across renames                     |
| `mode`        | The mode that just ended                                          |
| `now_in_mode` | The mode now in force                                             |
| `result`      | `completed` if it got where it was going, `expired` if it gave up |

`result` is the one to branch on. A command with an `until` that came true `completed`. One that hit its `duration` first, with the `until` still not true, `expired`. A command with only a `duration` and nothing to wait for always `completed`, because running its time out was the whole point.

Every value is a plain string, so a trigger can filter on them directly and you never need a template:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Export once the battery is full
    triggers:
      - trigger: event
        event_type: ef_powerocean_tcpmodbus_command_ended
        event_data:
          mode: charge_battery
          result: completed
    actions:
      - action: ef_powerocean_tcpmodbus.set_control
        target:
          entity_id: "{{ trigger.event.data.entity_id }}"
        data:
          mode: export_to_grid
          power: 5000
          duration: "02:00:00"
```

That reads as "once a charge command reaches its target, export for two hours". Had the charge simply run out of time without reaching 80%, `result` would be `expired` and the automation would not fire, which is what you want: there is nothing to export.

The event fires after the revert has been written, so by the time the automation runs the inverter is already in the mode `now_in_mode` names.

The event type is the same for every inverter. If you have more than one and want an automation to react to just the one, filter on `device_id`, which stays put even if you rename the device:

```yaml
    triggers:
      - trigger: event
        event_type: ef_powerocean_tcpmodbus_command_ended
        event_data:
          device_id: 1f4e9c2a7b3d84e6fa05c1938d72be40
          result: completed
```

### In an automation

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Charge on cheap power
    mode: single
    max_exceeded: silent
    triggers:
      - trigger: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.electricity_price
        below: 0.10
    conditions:
      - condition: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.ecoflow_powerocean_battery_soc
        below: 70
    actions:
      - action: ef_powerocean_tcpmodbus.set_control
        target:
          entity_id: select.ecoflow_powerocean_battery_mode
        data:
          mode: charge_battery
          power: 3000
          duration: "03:00:00"
          until:
            condition: numeric_state
            entity_id: sensor.ecoflow_powerocean_battery_soc
            above: 79
```

Keep `mode: single` on it. Price sensors update often, and an automation that retriggers will fight the integration's own 60 second minimum dwell between commands.

## Technical Details

- **Protocol:** Modbus TCP (port 502)
- **Reads:** Holding Registers (Function Code 3); multi-register values are decoded
  low word first (word-swapped)
- **Writes:** Function Code 6 for one register and Function Code 16 for multiple
  registers; multi-register values are encoded high word first
- **Float encoding:** 32-bit IEEE 754
- **Read strategy:** 3 block reads per poll cycle, grouped automatically from the
  register addresses, plus one device-information read when the connection opens
- **Tested firmware:** 3.0.19.19
- **Tested pymodbus version:** 3.6.9, 3.11.x and 3.13.x

The register map lives in [`const.py`](custom_components/ef_powerocean_tcpmodbus/const.py) as absolute Modbus addresses. For address numbering, word order, decoding and known gaps, see [EcoFlow_PowerOcean_Modbus.md](EcoFlow_PowerOcean_Modbus.md).
