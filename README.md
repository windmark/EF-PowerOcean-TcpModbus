## Battery Control

Off by default. Turning **Modbus Control** on makes the integration hold control
authority over the inverter, which **locks the EcoFlow app out control** for
as long as the integration is running and Modbus Control is turned on.

The **Battery Mode** select is the whole interface:

| Mode              | What the inverter does                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Automatic         | Self-consumption, exactly as the app runs it                                   |
| Hold battery      | Don't charge or discharge the battery. Surplus solar power is exported         |
| Charge battery    | Charges at the set power, importing from the grid if solar power is not enough |
| Discharge battery | Discharges at the set power                                                    |
| Export to grid    | Exports at the set power, uses the battery if solar power is not enough        |

Charge and Export are two views of the same thing: **Charge pins the battery and lets the
grid float, Export pins the grid and lets the battery float.** The setpoint is a target
rather than a cap in both directions, and as long as the battery has room the inverter
reaches it without limiting solar, with whatever is left over going to the battery or is
exported.

Two guards apply in every mode, including Automatic, and only ever restrict:

- **Charge Limit** – state of charge above which the battery is not charged (100 = off)
- **Battery Reserve** – state of charge below which it is not drained (0 = off)

Both default to off, so an untouched install never takes control away from the app.
**Control Status** reports what the selected mode is achieving, including when a guard
is holding it or when the battery has no headroom left to reach the target.

On the device page the two are deliberately kept apart:

| Section           | Entities                                                          | Meaning                                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Controls**      | Battery Mode, Charge/Discharge/Export Power                       | What you are asking the inverter to do right now                 |
| **Configuration** | Charge Limit, Battery Reserve, LED Brightness, Battery Saver Mode | Standing settings; the two guards bind whatever mode is selected |
| **Sensors**       | Control Status                                                    | What the inverter is actually doing about it                     |

Each mode's power stays editable while another mode is selected, so a command can be
set up before it is needed. Only the selected mode's value is ever sent.

## Development

Install the development dependencies and enable the formatting hooks:

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements-development.txt
pre-commit install
```

Run all linting and formatting checks manually with:

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

CI also runs these checks and will fail the workflow on any deviation.

## Technical Details

- **Protocol:** Modbus TCP (port 502)
- **Register type:** Holding Registers (Function Code 3)
- **Float encoding:** 32-bit IEEE 754, little-endian word order (word-swapped)
- **Read strategy:** 3 block reads per poll cycle, grouped automatically from the
  register addresses, plus one device-information read when the connection opens
- **Tested firmware:** 3.0.19.19
- **Tested pymodbus version:** 3.6.9, 3.11.x and 3.13.x

The register map lives in [`const.py`](custom_components/ef_powerocean_tcpmodbus/const.py) as absolute Modbus addresses. For address numbering, word order, decoding and known gaps, see [EcoFlow_PowerOcean_Modbus.md](EcoFlow_PowerOcean_Modbus.md).
